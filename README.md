# hello-world
This is my first github repository
My name is Zhaohan Yan, I graduated from Rutgers with BS. in CS and Math and I am a full time developer for ADP.

This is my new github account where I will manage it in daily bases. I have planned a path to become an full stack developer and here is the topics I will train myself with.

1. Github/Bitbucket 
2. Angular(Frontend Frameworks)
3. Java(Spring Boot and other Backend Frameworks)
4. Column oriented Database
5. AWS
6. GRE(Research and Acedemic Path)

Let me know if you have any recommendations that can help me become an better developer that can help human beings.
Thank you.
